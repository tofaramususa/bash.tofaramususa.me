# Web Terminal Portfolio

## Project Overview

This is a web-based terminal-style portfolio. It's designed to simulate the experience of interacting with a command-line interface in a unique and engaging way to learn about the my skills, projects, and background.

## Idea

 Instead of navigating through a traditional website layout, users can type commands to retrieve information, similar to how they would in a real terminal environment.

## Tools Used

- **JavaScript**: For creating the interactive command-line experience and handling user input.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web terminal's appearance.

## Information Displayed

The terminal provides a range of commands that users can input to retrieve different types of information, such as:

- **About**: A brief introduction to my professional background and interests.
- **Skills**: A list of technical and soft skills.
- **Projects**: Information about past and current projects, with links to repositories.
- **Education**: Academic history and achievements.
- **Socials**: Links to social media profiles and contact information.

Each command is designed to give a quick and clear insight into the relevant section, making the information easily accessible and user-friendly.

## Conclusion

It's a blend of nostalgia for the command-line interface and modern web development, resulting in a distinctive and engaging user experience.
